This directory contains source and documentation for TIPSY, a
theoretical image processing system.

To build, change directory to code, and type "configure".  This
shell script will find out what features are on your system and will
create a Makefile.  Inspect the Makefile to insure that the flags and
libraries are correct for your system, then type "make".  
A tipsy executable should be created in this directory.

For documentation within tipsy, set the environment variable
"TIPSYHELPDIR" to point at the man subdirectory.  Note that the
documentation is still being worked on.

The file "run99.ascii" in the current directory is an example data
file.

To quickly test out tipsy, try the commands:
openascii run99.ascii
readascii run99.bin
loadb 14
xall
