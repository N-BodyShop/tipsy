.TH XRAY  1 "22 MARCH 1994"  "Katz and Quinn Release 2.0" "TIPSY COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
xray \- make xray maps in different energy bands and write to FITS files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xray
.I min
.I max
.I filename
.I size
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xray
creates xray luminosity images and an x-ray emmission weighted
temperature image of
.I size
pixels on a side of the current projection.  The total xray luminosity
is written
to
.I filenametot.fits,
and the temperature image is written to
.I filenametemp.fits.
Luminosities in indivdual band are written to
.I filename_band_number.fits.
Images are are logarithmically scaled, and the minimum and maximum
pixel values are limited by
.I min
and
.I max
respectively.
Xray emmisivities for each band as a function of temperature are taken
from spline interpolations of tables which can be loaded with the
.B xrayload
command.
