.TH LOADBINARY  1 "22 MARCH 1994"  "KQ Release 2.0" "TIPSY COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
loadstandard \- load in data from a binary file in machine independent format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B loadstandard
.I time [ x-center y-center z-center x-hwidth y-hwidth z-hwidth ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B loadstandard
loads in the data at time
.I time
from the currently open binary file assuming it is in a machine
independent format.  This is format is defined by the XDR (external data
representation routines) specified by RFC1014.  If more than one time is
present in the binary file the time closest to 
.I time
is used.  It is typical (and useful) to have many sequential time outputs
in one tipsy binary file. If no binary file is open an error is generated.
Binary files can be opened using the
.B openbinary
command.
Standard binary files can be created using the
.B totipstd
program from the tipsy_tools package.  The data cannot be used until box 0 is
loaded using either the
.B loadall
or
.B setbox
command.
If the arguments
.I x-center y-center z-center x-hwidth y-hwidth z-hwidth
are given, then a subbox centered at
.I x-center y-center z-center
of half width
.I x-hwidth y-hwidth z-hwidth
is loaded.
