.TH MARKGAL  1 "22 MARCH 1994"  "KQ Release 2.0" "TIPSY COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
markgal \- mark gas particles that are likely to be in galaxies
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B markgal
.I box-number
.I max-temp
.I min-rho
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B markgal
marks all the gas particles in box
.I box-number
that have temperatures less than or equal to
.I max-temp
and have densities greater than or equal to
.I min-rho.
This command can be used to mark those gas particles that are likely
to be in galaxies.  Marked particles appear green in all plots.
Particles in a particular box can be unmarked using the
.B unmarkbox
command and all the marked particles can be unmarked using the
.B unmarkall
command.  Particles remain marked even when a new time frame is loaded but
after a new time frame is loaded any particles that were marked in the
previous time frame can only be unmarked using the
.B unmarkall
command.

Particles can also be marked using the
.B markarray
and
.B markbox
commands.
Statistics about marked particles can be determined using the
.B markstat
command. Marked particles can be written to a file using the
.B writemark
command or read from a file using the
.B readmark
command.

If the box
.I box-number
is not loaded an error is generated.
