.TH READVECTOR  1 "22 MARCH 1994"  "KQ Release 2.0" "TIPSY COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
readbinvector \- read a vector from binary file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B readbinvector
.I filename type
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B readbinvector
reads in a three dimensional vector for each particle from the file
.I filename
for use by commands like
.B viewmag
and
.B viewrad.
Using the
.B showvec
command the vector field can be displayed in plots.
The
.I type
option is either
.I float
or
.I double
to indicate the format of the file.

The file
.I filename
must be a binary file.  The file should be of the form:
.LP
.RS
.TP 3
ntotal
.TP 3
x_vector(i), i = 1 to ntotal
.TP 3
y_vector(i), i = 1 to ntotal
.TP 3
z_vector(i), i = 1 to ntotal
.RE

where ntotal is the total number of particles.
Therefore, the total file length is sizeof(int) + 3*ntotal*sizeof(float) bytes.

If
.I type
is
.I packeddouble
or
.I packedfloat
then the format of the file is
.LP
.RS
.TP 3
ntotal
.TP 3
x_vector(i), y_vector(i), z_vector(i), i = 1 to ntotal
.RE

The
.B readarray
command is used to read in scalars.
