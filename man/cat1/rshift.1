NAME
     redshift - set the redshift and coordinate system

SYNOPSIS
     redshift _z _c_o_o_r_d_i_n_a_t_e_s _h_u_b_b_l_e-_c_o_n_s_t_a_n_t _o_m_e_g_a _b_o_u_n_d_a_r_y _p_e_r_i_o_d

DESCRIPTION
     redshift sets the value of the redshift to _z for use in com-
     mands  such as vista. _c_o_o_r_d_i_n_a_t_e_s tells TIPSY if the simula-
     tion used comoving or physical coordinates.  If  _c_o_o_r_d_i_n_a_t_e_s
     is  "physical"  or  "p" this means physical coordinates were
     used and if _c_o_o_r_d_i_n_a_t_e_s is  "comoving"  or  "c"  this  means
     comoving coodinates were used.  _h_u_b_b_l_e-_c_o_n_s_t_a_n_t is the value
     of the hubble constant in km/sec/Mpc.  _b_o_u_n_d_a_r_y concerns the
     boundary  conditions.  If _b_o_u_n_d_a_r_y is "vacuum" or "v" vacuum
     boundary conditions are used and _p_e_r_i_o_d is ingored. If _b_o_u_n_-
     _d_a_r_y  is "periodic" or "p" then periodic boundary conditions
     are used with a period _p_e_r_i_o_d.
