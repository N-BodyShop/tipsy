DESCRIPTION
     coolconstants sets the value of  constants  that  relate  to
     cooling  for  use  in commands such as viewgas. All the con-
     stants are in system units with G  (the  gravitational  con-
     stant) equal to 1 and temperature in degrees Kelvin.

          _k_p_c_u_n_i_t
             is the system length unit in kiloparsecs.

          _m_s_o_l_u_n_i_t
             is the system mass unit in solar masses.

          _f_h_y_d_r_o_g_e_n
             is the fraction of the gas by weight in hydrogen  in
             the system.  the density.

          _j_n_u_2_1
             is the flux of the  background  radiation  field  in
             units of 10-21 ergs-1 cm-2 Hz-1 sr-1.

          _a_l_p_h_a_j
             is the slope of the  UV  background  spectrum,  j  =
             jnu21*(nu/nu_L)**(-alphaj).
