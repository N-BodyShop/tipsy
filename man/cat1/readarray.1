READARRAY(1)             TIPSY COMMANDS              READARRAY(1)



NAME
     readarray - read an array from a file

SYNOPSIS
     readarray _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

DESCRIPTION
     readarray reads in an array of  scalars  for  each  particle
     from  the  file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e for use by commands like arraystat,
     markarray, and viewarray.

     The file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e must be an ascii file. The file should  be
     of the form:

          ntotal

          array_value(i), i = 1 to ntotal

     where ntotal is the total number of  particles.   Therefore,
     the total file length is ntotal+1 lines.

     The readvector command is used to read in vectors.
