DESCRIPTION
     formconstants sets the value of  constants  that  relate  to
     star formation for use in commands such as viewgas. The star
     formation algorithm is from Katz  (Ap.  J.  391:502,  1992).
     All  the  constants are in system units with G (the gravita-
     tional constant) equal to 1 and temperature in degrees  Kel-
     vin.

          _c_s_t_a_r
             is the constant that is linearly proportional to the
             star formation rate.

          _d_t_i_m_e
             is the time between calls to the star formation rou-
             tine.

          _t_e_m_p_p_a_r
             is the constant that decides how cool the gas can be
             before the cooling time is ignored.

          _s_o_f_t_p_a_r
             is the constant that decides when  the  Jean's  cri-
             teria can be ignored.
