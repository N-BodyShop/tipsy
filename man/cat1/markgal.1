NAME
     markgal - mark gas particles that are likely to be in galax-
     ies

SYNOPSIS
     markgal _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r _m_a_x-_t_e_m_p _m_i_n-_r_h_o

DESCRIPTION
     markgal marks all the gas particles in box  _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r  that
     have  temperatures  less  than or equal to _m_a_x-_t_e_m_p and have
     densities greater than or equal to _m_i_n-_r_h_o. This command can
     be used to mark those gas particles that are likely to be in
     galaxies.  Marked particles appear green in all plots.  Par-
     ticles in a particular box can be unmarked using the unmark-
     box command and all the marked  particles  can  be  unmarked
     using  the  unmarkall command.  Particles remain marked even
     when a new time frame is loaded but after a new  time  frame
     is  loaded  any  particles  that were marked in the previous
     time frame can only be unmarked using the unmarkall command.

     Particles can also be marked using the markarray and markbox
     commands.   Statistics  about marked particles can be deter-
     mined using the markstat command. Marked  particles  can  be
     written to a file using the writemark command or read from a
     file using the readmark command.

     If the box _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r is not loaded an error is generated.
