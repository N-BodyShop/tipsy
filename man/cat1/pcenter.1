PCENTER(1)               TIPSY COMMANDS                PCENTER(1)



NAME
     pcenter - recenter a periodic box

SYNOPSIS
     pcenter  _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r  _c_e_n_t_e_r__x  _c_e_n_t_e_r__y  _c_e_n_t_e_r__z   _p_e_r_i_o_d__x
     _p_e_r_i_o_d__y _p_e_r_i_o_d__z

DESCRIPTION
     pcenter recenters the box _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r at (_c_e_n_t_e_r__x, _c_e_n_t_e_r__y,
     _c_e_n_t_e_r__z)  assuming  periodic  boundaries  with  a  periodic
     length in the x direction of _x__p_e_r_i_o_d, a periodic length  in
     the  y direction of _y__p_e_r_i_o_d, and a periodic length in the z
     direction  of  _z__p_e_r_i_o_d.  NOTE:  this  command   permanently
     changes  the  positions  of  all  the  particles in box _b_o_x-
     _n_u_m_b_e_r. If the box _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r is not loaded an error is gen-
     erated.

     Note that if the origional box 0 is not centered at (0,0,0),
     a  loadall  or  a  setbox 0 will be needed after the pcenter
     command.
