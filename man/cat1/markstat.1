MARKSTAT(1)              TIPSY COMMANDS               MARKSTAT(1)



NAME
     markstat - print physical parameters of marked particles

SYNOPSIS
     markstat _b_o_x _p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e

ALIASES
     mstat

DESCRIPTION
     markstat prints physical parameters of the marked  particles
     in box _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r for the marked particles of type _p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e.
     Parameters that are listed are: the mass, the  density,  the
     volume  of  the box, the size of the box, the center of mass
     coordinates, the center of mass velocity,  and  the  angular
     momentum per unit mass in the center of mass frame.  This is
     similar to the boxstat command but only for the marked  par-
     ticles.

     Particles can be marked using the markarray, markbox,  mark-
     gal,  and readmark commands. Marked particles can be written
     to a file using the writemark command.

     Particles in a particular box  can  be  unmarked  using  the
     unmarkbox  command  and  all  the  marked  particles  can be
     unmarked using  the  unmarkall  command.   Particles  remain
     marked  even when a new time frame is loaded but after a new
     time frame is loaded any particles that were marked  in  the
     previous time frame can only be unmarked using the unmarkall
     command.

     If no particles are marked  or  if  box  _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r  is  not
     loaded an error is generated.

             Show the physical parameters of all the marked  par-
             ticles.

             Show the physical parameters of only the marked dark
             matter particles.

          gas
             Show the physical parameters of only the marked  gas
