DESCRIPTION
     profile is a command that produces a file of name, _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e,
     that  contains  various  physical  profiles as a function of
     radius for particles of type _p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e in box, _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r. If
     the  box  _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r  or _c_e_n_t_e_r-_b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r are not loaded an
     error is generated.  Boxes can be loaded  using  either  the
     makebox, setbox, or setsphere commands.

     The center of the radial distribution is  taken  to  be  the
     center  of mass of the particles of the type _p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e in box
     _c_e_n_t_e_r-_b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r. If the string "pot" is given instead of a
     box  number  for the argument _c_e_n_t_e_r-_b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r the particle
     in box _b_o_x with the lowest potential energy is used  as  the
     center of the radial bins.

     The _p_r_o_j_e_c_t_i_o_n argument refers to the shape of the bins  and
     the _b_i_n_n_i_n_g argument refers to how the particles are binned,
     either linearly or log in radius.  There are _b_i_n-_n_u_m_b_e_r bins
     distributed  equally  in either radius or log radius between
     _m_i_n_i_m_u_m__r_a_d_i_u_s and the size of box _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r.

     The output file has the following columns: radius, number in
     bin,  density,  cumulative  mass  (M(<r)), circular velocity
     (sqrt(M(<r)/r)), radial velocity,  radial  velocity  disper-
     sion,  tangential  velocity, tangential velocity dispersion,
     specific angular momentum (j),j_theta, j_phi.   The  j_theta
     and j_phi angles specify the direction of the specific angu-
     lar momentum vector.  If _p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e is either _g_a_s, _b_a_r_y_o_n,  or
     _a_l_l  three  additional  columns  containing  the  mean  mass
     weighted gas density, mass  weighted  gas  temperature,  and
     mass weighted gas pressure are added.  If _p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e is either
     _s_t_a_r, _b_a_r_y_o_n or _a_l_l  an  additional  column  containing  the
     stellar  luminosity in the Johnson _V _b_a_n_d is added.  This is
     calculated using the ages of the star particles as  in  Katz
     (Ap.J. 391: 502, 1992).

             of  the  particles  of  type _p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e in box _c_e_n_t_e_r-
