       rreeaaddmmaaccrroo reads macro's from the	file _m_a_c_r_o_-_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_.  The
       file _m_a_c_r_o_-_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e can contain many different macro's.	A
       macro is	a sequential list of tipsy commands.  In the file
       _m_a_c_r_o_-_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e each macro must have as it first	line  the
       name  of	the macro and as its last line "end".  If a macro
       with that name already exists it	is deleted when	 the  new
       macro  is  read.	  In  the  file	put one	command	per line.
       Many different macro's can  be  in  the	one  file  _m_a_c_r_o_-
       _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e	one after the other.

       Macro's	can be executed	using the mmaaccrroo	command.  Macro's
       can be created interactively using the  mmaakkeemmaaccrroo  command
       and can be written to a file using the wwrriitteemmaaccrroo command.
       Macro's can be deleted using the	ddeelleetteemmaaccrroo command.
