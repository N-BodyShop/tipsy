MARKARRAY(1)             TIPSY COMMANDS              MARKARRAY(1)



NAME
     markarray - mark particles according to their array values

SYNOPSIS
     markarray _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r _m_i_n_i_m_u_m _m_a_x_i_m_u_m

DESCRIPTION
     markarray marks all the particles  in  box  _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r  that
     have array values between _m_i_n_i_m_u_m and _m_a_x_i_m_u_m, inclusive. If
     no array is loaded an error is generated.  Arrays  are  read
     in  using  the  readarray command.  If box _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r is not
     loaded an error is also generated.

     To unmark particles use either the  unmarkall  or  unmarkbox
     commands.   Remember, marked particles are always plotted in
     green.  Particles remain marked even when a new  time  frame
     is  loaded  but after a new time frame is loaded  any parti-
     cles that were marked in the previous time frame can only be
     unmarked  using the unmarkall command.  Marked particles can
     be written to a file using the  writemark  command  or  read
     from  a  file using the readmark command. Particles can also
     be marked using the markbox and markgal  commands.   Statis-
     tics  about  marked  particles  can  be determined using the
     markstat command.
