     plot

DESCRIPTION
     plot is a command that redraws the plot  using  the  current

     venient way to erase labels or redraw after the pointsize is
     changed using the pointsize command.  The command only works
     to redraw a plot that  was  already  made  with  either  the
     viewall,  viewarray,  viewgas, viewmag, viewpot, viewrad, or
     viewstar commands.
