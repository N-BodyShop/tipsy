NAME
     framepoints - write x, y, and z projections to files

SYNOPSIS
     framepoints _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r _p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e-_r_o_o_t

ALIASES
     frp

DESCRIPTION
     framepoints writes files that include the _x, _y, and  _z  pro-
     jections  for  all  particles  of  type _p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e in box _b_o_x-
     _n_u_m_b_e_r. This could be useful when  making  point  plots  for
     publication using a plotting package like mongo. Each parti-
     cle type and each projection  is  written  into  a  separate
     file.   The  filename  is the root _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e-_r_o_o_t with either
     _d_a_r_k, _g_a_s, or _s_t_a_r appended to signify the particle type and
     then  with either _x, _y, or _z appended to signify the projec-
     tion.  For example, the file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e-_r_o_o_tdarkx  would  con-
     tain  the  positions of all the dark matter particles in box
     _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r when viewed down the _x-axis.   If  the  box  _b_o_x-
     _n_u_m_b_e_r is not loaded an error is generated.

     The possible choices for _p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e are:

          all
             Write files that include the  dark,  gas,  and  star
             particles  in  box  _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r.  This  produces nine
             files in all.

          dark
             Write files that only include the dark particles  in
             box _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r. This produces three files in all.

          darkandgas
             Write files that include the dark and gas  particles
             in box _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r. This produces six files in all.

          darkandstar
             Write files that include the dark and star particles
             in box _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r. This produces six files in all.

          gas
             Write files that only include the gas  particles  in
             box _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r. This produces three files in all.

          gasandstar
             Write files that include the gas and star  particles
             in box _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r. This produces six files in all.

          star
             Write files that only include the star particles  in
             box _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r. This produces three files in all.
