NAME
     oldreadascii - read an old format ascii file

SYNOPSIS
     oldreadascii _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e _t_y_p_e

DESCRIPTION
     oldreadascii is a command to  read  in  the  currently  open
     ascii file if it is in the old ascii format and write it out
     in binary form into file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e. This command only  exists
     to  preserve backwards compatibility.  The readascii command
     is used for ascii files with the usual format.  If no  ascii
     file is open or if a binary file is already open an error is
     generated.  Ascii files are opened using the openascii  com-
     mand  and binary files are closed using the closebinary com-
     mand.  After the binary file is written the  ascii  file  is
     closed  and  the  binary file _f_i_l_e-_n_a_m_e is opened. After the
     binary file is made a specific time  must  still  be  loaded
     using  the  loadbinary  command  before  any plotting can be
     done.

     The ascii file should be of the old ascii form  and  contain
     all  the  time  frames  in sequential order.  If _t_y_p_e is sph
     each time frame should be of the form:

          ntotal, ndimensions, time, ngas, nstar

          mass(i), i = 1 to ntotal

          x_position(i), i = 1 to ntotal

          y_position(i), i = 1 to ntotal

          z_position(i), i = 1 to ntotal

          x_velocity(i), i = 1 to ntotal

          y_velocity(i), i = 1 to ntotal

          z_velocity(i), i = 1 to ntotal

          density(i), i = 1 to ngas

          temperature(i), i = 1 to ngas

          sph_smoothing_length(i), i = 1 to ngas,
     where ntotal is the total number of particles, ngas  is  the
     number  of  gas  particles,  and nstar is the number of star
     particles.  The first ngas particles should be the gas  par-
     ticles  and the last nstar particles should be the star par-
     ticles with the dark particles being in the middle.  If _t_y_p_e
     is nosph each time frame should be of the form:
