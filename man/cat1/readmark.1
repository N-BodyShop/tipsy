NAME
     readmark - read indices of marked particles from a file

SYNOPSIS
     readmark _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

DESCRIPTION
     readmark reads the indices of marked particles from the file
     _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  The  file  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e  must  be an ascii file.  The
     first line in the file is:

          ntotal, ngas, nstar

     where ntotal is the total number of particles, ngas  is  the
     number  of gas particles, ndark is the number of dark matter
     particles, and nstar is the number of star particles.  Every
     additional  line should contain the index of a marked parti-
     cle (particle's indices start with one) in increasing numer-
     ical order.

     Marked particles appear green in plots.  Particles in a par-
     ticular  box can be unmarked using the unmarkbox command and
     all the marked particles can be unmarked using the unmarkall
     command.  Particles remain marked even when a new time frame
     is loaded.  Particles can also be marked using  the  markar-
     ray, markbox, and markgal commands.  Statistics about marked
     particles can be  determined  using  the  markstat  command.
     Marked  particles  can be written to a file using the write-
     mark command.
