SETSPHERE(1)             TIPSY COMMANDS              SETSPHERE(1)



NAME
     setsphere - make and load a spherical "box" from the command
     line

SYNOPSIS
     setsphere _b_o_x _x_c_e_n_t_e_r _y_c_e_n_t_e_r _z_c_e_n_t_e_r _r_a_d_i_u_s

DESCRIPTION
     setsphere is used to define the boundaries  of  _b_o_x  through
     the  command  line.  The requested box must be between 1 and
     _M_A_X_B_O_X or an error will be generated.  The value  of  _M_A_X_B_O_X
     can  be  found  by  using the version command.  The box is a
     sphere  of  radius  _r_a_d_i_u_s  centered  on   the   coordinates
     (_x_c_e_n_t_e_r, _y_c_e_n_t_e_r, _z_c_e_n_t_e_r).

     Once a box is made and loaded it still isn't the active  box
     for  plotting  until the activatebox command is used.  Boxes
     are removed using the unload command.

     Boxes with numbers greater than box 0 cannot be  made  until
     box  0  is  loaded.  Boxes can also be made and loaded using
     the makebox and setbox commands.  Box 0 can also be made and
     loaded using the loadall command.

SEE ALSO
     activatebox(1),    loadall(1),    makebox(1),     setbox(1),
     unload(1), version(1)

BUGS
     The volume of the box is not done correctly in commands such
     as  boxstat  and  the  box  is  not  plotted  correctly when
     showboxes is _y_e_s if the box is spherical.
