NNAAMMEE
       setsphere  - make and load a spherical "box" from the com-
       mand line

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       sseettsspphheerree is used to define the boundaries of _b_o_x  through
       the command line.  The requested box must be between 1 and
       _M_A_X_B_O_X or an error will be generated.  The value of _M_A_X_B_O_X
       can  be  found by using the vveerrssiioonn command.  The box is a
       sphere of radius _r_a_d_i_u_s centered on the coordinates _(_x_c_e_n_-
       _t_e_r_, _y_c_e_n_t_e_r_, _z_c_e_n_t_e_r_)_.

       Once  a  box  is made and loaded it still isn't the active
       box for plotting until the aaccttiivvaatteebbooxx  command  is  used.
       Boxes are removed using the uunnllooaadd command.

       Boxes with numbers greater than box 0 cannot be made until
       box 0 is loaded.  Boxes can also be made and loaded  using
       the  mmaakkeebbooxx  and sseettbbooxx commands.  Box 0 can also be made
       and loaded using the llooaaddaallll command.

BBUUGGSS
       The  volume  of  the box is not done correctly in commands
       such as bbooxxssttaatt and the box is not plotted correctly  when
       sshhoowwbbooxxeess is _y_e_s if the box is spherical.
