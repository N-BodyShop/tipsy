ROTATE(1)                TIPSY COMMANDS                 ROTATE(1)



NAME
     rotate - rotate the viewing angle

SYNOPSIS
     rotate _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n _d_e_g_r_e_e_s

DESCRIPTION
     rotate is a command to  rotate  the  viewing  angle  _d_e_g_r_e_e_s
     degress  in  the  direction _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n. _d_e_g_r_e_e_s may be either
     positive or negative.  To view the particles  from  the  new
     direction  the rotate command must be followed by either the
     viewall, viewarray, viewgas, viewmag, viewpot,  viewrad,  or
     viewstar  commands.  The clearrot command resets the viewing
     angle to be looking down the _z-axis.   The  angleup  command
     can  also  be used to rotate the simulation depending on the
     system's angular momentum.

OPTIONS
  Direction
     The possible choices for _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n are:

          left
             Rotate  the  viewing  angle  to  the  left   _d_e_g_r_e_e_s
             degrees.  This option may be abbreviated l

          right
             Rotate  the  viewing  angle  to  the  right  _d_e_g_r_e_e_s
             degrees.  This option may be abbreviated r

          up Rotate the viewing angle up _d_e_g_r_e_e_s  degrees.   This
             option may be abbreviated u

          down
             Rotate the viewing angle down _d_e_g_r_e_e_s degrees.  This
             option may be abbreviated d

          clockwise
             Rotate the viewing angle clockwise _d_e_g_r_e_e_s  degrees.
             This option may be abbreviated c
