MAKEBOX(1)               TIPSY COMMANDS                MAKEBOX(1)



NAME
     makebox - make and load a box interactively

SYNOPSIS
     makebox _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r

ALIASES
     mbox

DESCRIPTION
     makebox is used to define the boundaries of  box  _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r
     interactively and then load that box. The requested box must
     be between 1 and _M_A_X_B_O_X or an error will be generated.   The
     value  of  _M_A_X_B_O_X can be found by using the version command.
     If the currently plotted box is  not  the  currently  active
     box,  or  if  the  internal state has been altered since the
     last plot an error is generated.

     Once the command is executed a pointer will  appear  on  the
     view  surface.     Click the left mouse button while holding
     down the shift key at the desired location of the lower left
     hand  corner  of  box  _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r. This fixes the lower left
     hand corner of the box.  As the pointer is moved  using  the
     mouse, the outline of the box is plotted in green.  Once the
     pointer is at the desired location of the upper  right  hand
     corner  of  the box, again click the left mouse button while
     holding down the shift key.  The image is then rotated  down
     90  degrees  and  redisplayed so that the other two edges of
     the box can be defined.  The green line shows the  projected
     edge of the box that was just previously defined.  Press the
     left mouse button while holding down the shift  key  at  the
     desired  bottom  edge  and press it again while holding down
     the shift key at the desired top edge.

     Remember, during the whole operation of the makebox command,
     the mouse keys perform their normal functions: zoom, unzoom,
     and pan.  These can be used to aid the construction  of  the
     box.   Only if the shift key is held down while pressing the
     left mouse button will the makebox command record the  posi-
     tion.   If the shift key isn't held down the image will just
     be zoomed as per usual.  Once a box is made  and  loaded  it
     still  isn't  the  active box for plotting until the activa-
     tebox command is used.  Boxes are removed using  the  unload
     command.

     Boxes can also be made and loaded using the setbox and  set-
     sphere  commands.   Box  0 can also be made and loaded using
     the  loadall  command.   Boxes  can  be  plotted  using  the
     showboxes command.
