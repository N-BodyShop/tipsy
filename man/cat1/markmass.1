NAME
     markmass - mark particles according to their mass

SYNOPSIS
     markmass _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r _m_i_n_i_m_u_m _m_a_x_i_m_u_m

DESCRIPTION
     markmass marks all the particles in box _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r that have
     masses  between  _m_i_n_i_m_u_m and _m_a_x_i_m_u_m, inclusive. If box _b_o_x-
     _n_u_m_b_e_r is not loaded an error is generated.

     To unmark particles use either the  unmarkall  or  unmarkbox
     commands.   Remember, marked particles are always plotted in
     green.  Particles remain marked even when a new  time  frame
     is  loaded  but after a new time frame is loaded  any parti-
     cles that were marked in the previous time frame can only be
     unmarked  using the unmarkall command.  Marked particles can
     be written to a file using the  writemark  command  or  read
     from  a  file using the readmark command. Particles can also
     be marked using the markarray, markbox and markgal commands.
     Statistics  about  marked  particles can be determined using
     the markstat command.
