SETBOX(1)                TIPSY COMMANDS                 SETBOX(1)



NAME
     setbox - make and load a box from the command line

SYNOPSIS
     setbox _b_o_x _x_m_i_n _x_m_a_x _y_m_i_n _y_m_a_x _z_m_i_n _z_m_a_x

DESCRIPTION
     setbox is used to define the boundaries of _b_o_x  through  the
     command  line.  The requested box must be between 1 and _M_A_X_-
     _B_O_X or an error will be generated.  The value of _M_A_X_B_O_X  can
     be found by using the version command.  The box extends from
     _x_m_i_n to _x_m_a_x in the x direction, from _y_m_i_n to _y_m_a_x in the  y
     direction, and from _z_m_i_n to _z_m_a_x in the z direction.

     Once a box is made and loaded it still isn't the active  box
     for  plotting  until the activatebox command is used.  Boxes
     are removed using the unload command.

     Boxes with numbers greater than box 0 cannot be  made  until
     box  0  is  loaded.  Boxes can also be made and loaded using
     the makebox and setsphere commands.  Box 0 can also be  made
     and  loaded  using the loadall command. Boxes can be plotted
     using the showboxes command.
