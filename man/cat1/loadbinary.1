LOADBINARY(1)            TIPSY COMMANDS             LOADBINARY(1)



NAME
     loadbinary - load in data from a binary file

SYNOPSIS
     loadbinary _t_i_m_e

ALIASES
     loadb

DESCRIPTION
     loadbinary loads in the data at time _t_i_m_e from the currently
     open  binary  file.  If more than one time is present in the
     binary file the time closest to _t_i_m_e is used.  It is typical
     (and  useful)  to  have  many sequential time outputs in one
     tipsy binary file. If no binary file is  open  an  error  is
     generated.   Binary files can be opened using the openbinary
     command.  Binary files can be created  using  the  readascii
     command  or  the  ascii2binary  program.  The data cannot be
     used until box 0 is loaded using either the loadall or  set-
     box command.
