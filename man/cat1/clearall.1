NAME
     clearall - equivalent to clearrot, unloadall, and unmarkall

     clearall

DESCRIPTION
     clearall resets the viewing angle to  be  looking  down  the
     _z-axis,  unloads all the boxes except box 0, and unmarks all
     the particles.  To view the particles from the new direction
     the  clearall  command  must  be followed by either the view
     command to maintain  the  same  plot  type  or  by  viewall,
     viewarray,  viewgas,  viewmag, viewpot, viewrad, or viewstar
     commands.  Its single action is equivalent to the three com-
     mands: clearrot, unloadall, and unmarkall.
