NAME
     moments - write the shape as a funtion of radius

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
     moments is a command that produces a file of name, _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e,
     that contains various physical parameters that relate to the
     shape and orientation of the density distribution for parti-
     cles  of type _p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e in box, _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r. If the boxes _b_o_x-
     _n_u_m_b_e_r or _c_e_n_t_e_r-_b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r are not loaded an error is  gen-
     erated.   The  shapes  and orientations are calculated using
     the iterative technique described in  Katz  (Ap.J.  368:325,
     1991).  The initial guess for the center of the density dis-
     tribution is taken to be the center of mass of  box  _c_e_n_t_e_r-
     _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r. The _b_i_n_n_i_n_g argument refers to how the particles
     are binned, either linearly or log  in  radius.   There  are
     _b_i_n-_n_u_m_b_e_r  equal size bins distributed equally in radius or
     log radius between _m_i_n_i_m_u_m__r_a_d_i_u_s and the size of  box  _b_o_x-
     _n_u_m_b_e_r  depending  on the _b_i_n_n_i_n_g argument.  The output file
     has the following columns: radius,  b/a,  c/a,  phi,  theta,
     psi,  center-x,center-y,and center-z where b/a refers to the
     ratio between the intermediate axis and the  long  axis  and
     c/a  refers  to  the  ratio between the short and long axes.
     Phi, theta and psi refer to the Euler angles  that  describe
     the orientation of the density distribution.

BUGS
     The technique doesn't always  converge,  particularily  when
     the  density  distribution  is very clumpy.  Things converge
     much better when the box _c_e_n_t_e_r-_b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r contains the true
     center for the density distribution in box _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r and is
     as small as possible.
