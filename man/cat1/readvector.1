READVECTOR(1)            TIPSY COMMANDS             READVECTOR(1)



NAME
     readvector - read a vector

SYNOPSIS
     readvector _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

DESCRIPTION
     readvector reads in a three dimensional vector for each par-
     ticle  from  the  file  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e  for  use  by commands like
     viewmag and viewrad. Using the showvec  command  the  vector
     field can be displayed in plots.

     The file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e must be an ascii file.  The file should be
     of the form:

          ntotal

          x_vector(i), i = 1 to ntotal

          y_vector(i), i = 1 to ntotal

          z_vector(i), i = 1 to ntotal

     where ntotal is the total number of  particles.   Therefore,
     the total file length is 3*ntotal+1 lines.

     The readarray command is used to read in scalars.
