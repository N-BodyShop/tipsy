       rreeaaddvveeccttoorr  reads  in  a three dimensional vector for each
       particle from the file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e for use by  commands  like
       vviieewwmmaagg and vviieewwrraadd..  Using the sshhoowwvveecc command the vector
       field can be displayed in plots.

       The file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e must be an ascii file.  The file  should
       be of the form:


              ntotal

              x_vector(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              y_vector(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              z_vector(i), i = 1 to ntotal

       where ntotal is the total number of particles.  Therefore,
       the total file length is 3*ntotal+1 lines.

       The rreeaaddaarrrraayy command is used to read in scalars.
