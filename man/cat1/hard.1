	  hhhhaaaarrrrdddd redraws the current plot	full screen size and writes a
	  xwd format file of the image into the	file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e so that
	  it can be sent to a color printer or displayed again later.
	  The image is written when any	mouse button is	pressed.
	  Carefully center the image on	the screen before pressing a
	  mouse	button because what you	see is what you	get.  If
	  nothing is currently plotted an error	will be	generated.
	  There	are a few special _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_s that cause the command to
	  behave slightly differently.

	  If the _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is ````````pppprrrriiiinnnntttt'''''''' no file is written but instead
	  a postscript file is sent to the default printer to be
	  printed in black and white.

	  If the _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is ````````ccccoooolllloooorrrrpppprrrriiiinnnntttt'''''''' no file is written but
	  instead a color postscript file is sent to the default
	  printer to be	printed	in color.

	  If the _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is ````````pppphhhhoooottttoooo'''''''' no file is written and the
	  image	remains	on the screen until a button is	pressed.  This
	  command is useful when taking	pictures of the	images.

	  If the _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is ````````mmmmoooovvvviiiieeee'''''''' a file is written to file
	  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e that	contains the image in the current window but
	  with the same	size as	the current window.  Also, the command
	  does not wait	for a mouse button to be pressed to write the
	  file.	 It is important to make certain that the entire view
	  area is uncovered when using this option because what	you
	  see is what you get.	This command is	useful for making
	  movies.

	  If the _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is ````````dddduuuummmmpppp'''''''' an image is written to the file
	  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e. The	image contains the contents of the backing
	  pixmap which tipsy uses to refresh the current window.  This
	  is useful if the window is larger than the display.
