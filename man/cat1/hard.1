HARD(1)                  TIPSY COMMANDS                   HARD(1)



NAME
     hard - make an X window dump (and send it to the printer)

SYNOPSIS
     hard _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

DESCRIPTION
     hard redraws the current plot full screen size and writes  a
     xwd  format file of the image into the file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e so that
     it can be sent to a color printer or displayed again  later.
     The  image  is  written  when  any  mouse button is pressed.
     Carefully center the image on the screen before  pressing  a
     mouse button because what you see is what you get.  If noth-
     ing is currently plotted an error will be generated.   There
     are a few special _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_s that cause the command to behave
     slightly differently.

     If the _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is ``print'' no file is written but  instead
     a  postscript  file  is  sent  to  the default printer to be
     printed in black and white.

     If the _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is ``colorprint'' no  file  is  written  but
     instead  a  color  postscript  file  is  sent to the default
     printer to be printed in color.

     If the _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is ``photo'' no  file  is  written  and  the
     image remains on the screen until a button is pressed.  This
     command is useful when taking pictures of the images.

     If the _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is ``movie''  a  file  is  written  to  file
     _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e  that  contains the image in the current window but
     with the same size as the current window.  Also, the command
     does  not wait for a mouse button to be pressed to write the
     file.  It is important to make certain that the entire  view
     area  is  uncovered  when using this option because what you
     see is what you get.  This  command  is  useful  for  making
     movies.
