POINTSIZE(1)             TIPSY COMMANDS              POINTSIZE(1)



NAME
     pointsize - set the pointsize for plotted particles

SYNOPSIS
     pointsize _p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e _s_i_z_e

ALIASES
     psize

DESCRIPTION
     pointsize is a command that sets the  size,  in  pixels,  of
     particles  of  type  _p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e to _s_i_z_e when they are plotted.
     If _s_i_z_e is less than 1.0 they are just plotted one pixel  in
     size.  The default is a _s_i_z_e of 0.  The particle size is not
     changed until the plot is redrawn using a command like plot.

OPTIONS
  Particle
     The possible choices for _p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e are:

          dark
             Set the size of plotted  dark  matter  particles  to
             _s_i_z_e pixels

          gas
             Set the size of plotted gas particles to _s_i_z_e pixels

          star
             Set the size of plotted star particles to _s_i_z_e  pix-
             els

          mark
             Set the size of marked particles to _s_i_z_e pixels
