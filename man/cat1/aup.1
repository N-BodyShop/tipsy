ANGLEUP(1)               TIPSY COMMANDS                ANGLEUP(1)



NAME
     angleup - change the viewing angle to edge-on

SYNOPSIS
     angleup _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r _p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e

ALIASES
     aup

DESCRIPTION
     angleup changes the viewing angle so that the angular momen-
     tum  vector  of  particle  type  _p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e  in box _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r
     points straight up and lies in  the  plane  of  the  screen.
     Remember  that  the  angular  momentum  vector  of  any  box
     excludes the center of mass motion of the box.  To view  the
     particles from the new direction the angleup command must be
     followed by either the view command  to  maintain  the  same
     plot  type  or  by  viewall,  viewarray,  viewgas,  viewmag,
     viewpot, viewrad, or viewstar commands.   If  the  box  _b_o_x-
     _n_u_m_b_e_r is not loaded an error is generated.

OPTIONS
  Particle
     The possible choices for _p_a_r_t_i_c_l_e are:

          all
             Use the angular momentum vector of all the particles
             in box _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r

          dark
             Use the angular momentum vector  of  only  the  dark
             matter particles in box _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r

          gas
             Use the angular momentum vector of only the gas par-
             ticles in box _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r

          star
             Use the angular momentum vector  of  only  the  star
             particles in box _b_o_x-_n_u_m_b_e_r
